# Radar Tracking Simulation with Kalman Filter

This Python project simulates a 2D object moving through space, with radar measurements and estimation using a Kalman filter.

### Features
- Simulates object motion with velocity
- Adds Gaussian noise to radar readings
- Implements a 2D Kalman filter
- Real-time animated tracking plot

### Tech Stack
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Run It
```bash
python main.py
